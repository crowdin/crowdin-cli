Without it, translators are left to guess the meaning of short strings, UI labels, and ambiguous phrases - leading to inaccurate translations, longer review cycles, and frustrated localization teams.\\n\\nThe new Crowdin CLI [context management](/commands/crowdin-context) commands make it easy to manage string context at scale, directly from your terminal.\\n\\nIn this post, we\'ll walk through a practical workflow: download your strings, enrich them using an AI agent with the help of [Crowdin Skills](https://github.com/crowdin/skills), and push the result back to Crowdin.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## The Workflow\\n\\nA string like `Name` or `Post` means something very different depending on where it appears in your app. Is it username or post title? Is it a label or a button? Without context, translators must guess - and guesses lead to mistakes.\\n\\nThe context enrichment workflow with Crowdin CLI is straightforward:\\n\\n1. **Download** strings context to a local file\\n2. **Enrich** the context using an AI agent\\n3. **Upload** the enriched context back to Crowdin\\n\\nLet\'s walk through each step.\\n\\n## Step 0: Install Crowdin Skills\\n\\n[Crowdin Skills](https://github.com/crowdin/skills) is a collection of agent skills that teach your AI agent how to work with Crowdin - including how to correctly fill string context.\\n\\nInstall all Crowdin skills with a single command:\\n\\n```bash\\nnpx skills add crowdin/skills\\n```\\n\\nThis installs two skills relevant to context enrichment:\\n\\n- `crowdin-context-cli` - documents the `context download` and `context upload` CLI commands so the agent understands the full workflow and the JSONL format.\\n- `context-extraction` - teaches the agent how to write good context descriptions: which strings need context (ambiguous short words, plurals, UI labels with inline formatting), how to write concise 1\u20133 sentence descriptions that explain the UI element type and placement, and what *not* to touch in the file.\\n\\n## Step 1: Download Strings Context\\n\\nThe [`context download`](/commands/crowdin-context-download) command exports your project\'s strings to a local `.jsonl` file, ready for AI enrichment.\\n\\n```bash\\ncrowdin context download\\n```\\n\\nBy default, this creates a `crowdin-context.jsonl` file in the current directory. You can also customize the output path with the `--to` option. You don\'t need to execute this command manually. There is no need to execute this command manually. The agent can do it for you when you ask it to.\\n\\n:::info\\nJSONL is a line-delimited format that is easy to parse and write. It is a good format for AI agents to work with. There are many IDE extensions available, such as [JSONL Gazelle](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=gabor.jsonl-gazelle) for VS Code. It allows you to view the JSONL file content in a more readable format.\\n:::\\n\\n#### Filtering Strings\\n\\nYou rarely need to enrich all strings at once. The command supports a range of filters so you can focus on exactly what matters:\\n\\n| Filter             | Description                                        | Example Command                                      |\\n|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|\\n| By file            | Process strings from specific source files         | `crowdin context download -f \\"src/ui/**\\"`            |\\n| By label           | Target strings with specific labels                | `crowdin context download --label needs-context`     |\\n| By context status  | Only download strings that are missing context     | `crowdin context download --status empty`            |\\n| By date            | Only strings created after a specific date         | `crowdin context download --since 2026-01-01`        |\\n| By branch          | Only strings from a specific branch                | `crowdin context download -b main`                   |\\n\\nThese filters are especially useful when running context enrichment as part of a CI/CD pipeline or when incrementally updating context for new strings.\\n\\n## Step 2: Enrich Context with AI Agents\\n\\nYour AI agent already knows your codebase, so it can write the best description possible for your strings. Once you have your `crowdin-context.jsonl` file, it\'s time to let the agent do the heavy lifting.\\n\\n:::tip\\nJust **ask your agent** to enrich the context. It will use the Crowdin CLI to download and upload context, and the `context-extraction` skill to write good descriptions.\\n:::\\n\\n## Step 3: Upload Enriched Context\\n\\nOnce your AI agent has enriched the `crowdin-context.jsonl` file, upload it back to Crowdin with the [`context upload`](/commands/crowdin-context-upload) command:\\n\\n```bash\\ncrowdin context upload\\n```\\n\\nUse the `--from` option if you used a custom path with `--to` during download.\\n\\n## Additional Commands\\n\\n### Check Context Coverage\\n\\nThe [`context status`](/commands/crowdin-context-status) command gives you a quick overview of how much of your project has context filled in:\\n\\n```bash\\ncrowdin context status\\n\u2714\ufe0f  Fetching project info    \\nContext Status for Project \\"Demo\\" (ID: 00000)\\n\\nTotal strings:       3484\\nWith AI context:     50 (1.44%)\\nWithout AI context:  3434 (98.56%)\\nWith manual context: 3484 (100.00%)\\n```\\n\\nUse `--by-file` to see a breakdown per source file - useful for spotting which files need the most attention.\\n\\n### Reset AI-Generated Context\\n\\nThe [`context reset`](/commands/crowdin-context-reset) command removes AI-generated context from strings while preserving any manually written context:\\n\\n```bash\\ncrowdin context reset --all\\n```\\n\\nYou can scope the reset to specific files, labels, or branches using the same filtering options available on the other commands. The `--all` flag is required when no filter is specified, as a safety measure against accidental bulk resets.\\n\\n## Summary\\n\\nThis post showed how to enrich your project\'s string context using Crowdin CLI and an AI agent. The workflow: install [Crowdin Skills](https://github.com/crowdin/skills), download strings to a local JSONL file, ask your agent to fill in context, then upload the result back to Crowdin. Use context status to check coverage and context reset to remove AI-generated context when needed.\\n\\n:::tip Share your feedback\\n[Visit our GitHub discussions](https://github.com/crowdin/crowdin-cli/discussions/992) to share your feedback on the context commands.\\n:::"},{"id":"/2024/05/28/cli-v4","metadata":{"permalink":"/crowdin-cli/blog/2024/05/28/cli-v4","editUrl":"https://github.com/lingui/js-lingui/tree/main/website/blog/2024-05-28-cli-v4/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-05-28-cli-v4/index.md","title":"Crowdin CLI 4.0","description":"Learn how to manage your project\'s localization files from the command line.

The command now requires the <kbd>--file</kbd> parameter for file-based projects. The <kbd>--file</kbd> parameter determines which files to pre-translate. Previously, the command relied on the current configuration, and it was only possible to pre-translate the files that matched the configuration patterns.

The supported environment variables are:\\n\\n- `CROWDIN_PROJECT_ID`\\n- `CROWDIN_PERSONAL_TOKEN`\\n- `CROWDIN_BASE_PATH`\\n- `CROWDIN_BASE_URL`\\n\\nThanks to this change, it\'s now easier to work with the CLI in CI/CD environments, especially in the no-configuration-file use case.\\n\\nVisit the [Configuration File](/configuration#environment-variables) article for more details.\\n\\n## Deprecations and backward compatibility\\n\\n### Download targets\\n\\nThe deprecated `download targets` command has been removed. The configuration file no longer supports the `targets` section as well. Use [Bundles](/commands/crowdin-bundle) instead.\\n\\n### Task command\\n\\nRemoved backward compatibility for file numeric id in the [`task add`](/commands/crowdin-task-add) command. Now only file path is supported:\\n\\n```diff\\n-crowdin task add --file 12 --language uk\\n+crowdin task add --file src/strings.xml --language uk\\n```\\n\\n## Command output updates\\n\\nIn this release, we\'ve also reviewed and improved the output of many commands to make them more informative and user-friendly. Changes include `list`, `add`, `upload`, `download`, `delete`, and other commands for various resources.\\n\\n:::tip\\nNeed help or have questions?

You can easily synchronize your source language files and translations with your Crowdin project.\\n\\nThere are several commands you can use to manage your files. The CLI provides high-level commands that are easy to use and low-level commands that give you more flexibility and control.\\n\\nThe high level commands are [`crowdin upload`](/commands/crowdin-upload) and [`crowdin download`](/commands/crowdin-download). These commands are easy to use and they rely mostly on the configuration file.\\n\\nThe low-level commands include [`crowdin file upload`](/commands/crowdin-file-upload), [`crowdin file download`](/commands/crowdin-file-download), and [`crowdin file delete`](/commands/crowdin-file-delete). These commands are more like a lightweight wrapper over the [Crowdin API](https://developer.crowdin.com/api/v2/). They give you more flexibility and control over the file management process.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## The `upload` and `download` commands\\n\\n### Configuration\\n\\nThese commands are usually being used along with the configuration file.\\n\\nFor example, you have a project with the following structure:\\n\\n```bash\\n.\\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 locales\\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 en\\n\u2502   \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 messages.xml\\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 fr\\n\u2502   \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 messages.xml\\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 de\\n\u2502   \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 messages.xml\\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 uk\\n\u2502       \u2514\u2500\u2500 messages.xml\\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 ...\\n```\\n\\nLet\'s create a simple configuration file:\\n\\n```bash\\ncrowdin init -s \\"locales/en/*.xml\\" -t \\"locales/%two_letters_code%/%original_file_name%\\"\\n```\\n\\nThis command prompts you for the project identifier and API token. It will then create a configuration file with the following content:\\n\\n```yaml\\n\\"project_id\\": \\"<your-crowdin-project-id>\\"\\n\\"api_token\\": \\"<your-personal-access-token>\\"\\n\\"base_path\\": \\".\\"\\n\\"base_url\\": \\"https://api.crowdin.com\\"\\n\\n\\"preserve_hierarchy\\": true\\n\\nfiles: [\\n  {\\n    \\"source\\": \\"locales/en/*.xml\\",\\n    \\"translation\\": \\"locales/%two_letters_code%/%original_file_name%\\"\\n  }\\n]\\n```\\n\\nLet\'s take a closer look at some of the configuration options.\\n\\nThe `source` and `translation` configurations represent the patterns for the source and translation files. The `source` configuration is a [glob](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)) pattern pointing to the source files. The `translation` configuration is a path to the translation files (existing ones or where to put downloaded translations). The `%two_letters_code%` and `%original_file_name%` are the placeholders that will be replaced by the language code and the original source file name, respectively.\\n\\n:::info\\nVisit the [Configuration](/configuration) page to learn more about the configuration file.\\n:::\\n\\n### Upload content\\n\\nLet\'s **upload** the source files and existing translations to Crowdin:\\n\\n```bash\\ncrowdin upload sources\\ncrowdin upload translations -l fr\\n```\\n\\nWe can also check the translation and proofreading progress before downloading the translations:\\n\\n```bash\\ncrowdin status\\n```\\n\\n### Download content\\n\\nWhen the translations are ready, we can **download** them:\\n\\n```bash\\ncrowdin download translations\\n```\\n\\nThe above command will download all the translations to the path specified in the `translation` configuration.\\n\\n:::tip\\nYou can also use short aliases: `crowdin push`, `crowdin pull`.\\n:::\\n\\nTo download the source files from Crowdin, run the following command:\\n\\n```bash\\ncrowdin download sources\\n```\\n\\n## The `file` command\\n\\nThe [`file`](/commands/crowdin-file) command is a low-level command that allows you to manage your files with more flexibility and control.\\n\\nThis command does not require a `files` section in the configuration file, or a configuration file at all. You can specify all the necessary parameters in the command itself.\\n\\n### Upload content\\n\\nLet\'s use the same project structure as in the previous example and try to **upload** the source files and existing translations to Crowdin:\\n\\n```bash\\ncrowdin file upload locales/en/messages.xml -d messages.xml\\n```\\n\\nThe command above will take the file `locales/en/messages.xml` and upload it to Crowdin as `messages.xml` in the root directory. The `-d`/`--dest` option stands for `destination` and allows you to specify the path to the file in Crowdin. If you omit the `-d` option, the file will be uploaded to the root directory with the same path as the source file.\\n\\nYou can upload strings to string-based projects as well:\\n\\n```bash\\ncrowdin file upload locales/en/messages.xml --branch main --cleanup-mode --update-strings\\n```\\n\\nThe `--branch` option is required for string-based projects. The `--cleanup-mode` and `--update-strings` options are optional. Use the `--update-strings` option to update strings with the same identifiers and the `--cleanup-mode` option to remove strings that are not present in the uploaded file.\\n\\nTo **upload translations** you need to specify the `-l`/`--language` option:\\n\\n```bash\\ncrowdin file upload locales/fr/messages.xml -d messages.xml -l fr\\n```\\n\\nThe `-d`/`--dest` option is the path to the file in Crowdin where the translations should be uploaded. `-l` - [Crowdin language code](https://developer.crowdin.com/language-codes/).\\n\\nVisit the [`crowdin file upload`](/commands/crowdin-file-upload) page to see all the options available.\\n\\n### Download content\\n\\nUsing the `crowdin file download` you can download either the source files or translations. Let\'s try to download the source file from Crowdin:\\n\\n```bash\\ncrowdin file download messages.xml -d locales/en/messages.xml\\n```\\n\\nThe above command will download the `messages.xml` file from Crowdin and store it in the `locales/en/messages.xml` path.\\n\\nTo download translations, you need to specify the `-l`/`--language` option:\\n\\n```bash\\ncrowdin file download messages.xml -d locales/fr -l fr\\n```\\n\\nThe `-d`/`--dest` option here is the path to the file on your local machine where the translations should be stored. `-l` - [Crowdin language code](https://developer.crowdin.com/language-codes/).\\n\\n:::info\\nYou can also use language code placeholders in the `--dest` option. For example, `locales/%android_code%`.\\nAvailable codes: `%two_letters_code%`, `%three_letters_code%`, `%locale%`, `%android_code%`, `%osx_code%`, `%osx_locale%`.\\n:::\\n\\nVisit the [`crowdin file download`](/commands/crowdin-file-download) page to see all the available options.\\n\\n:::tip\\nThe `file` commands can easily be used without the configuration file. For example:\\n\\n```bash\\ncrowdin file upload locales/en/messages.xml \\\\\\n  -d messages.xml \\\\\\n  -i <your-project-id> \\\\\\n  -T <your-personal-access-token> \\\\\\n  /\\n```\\n:::\\n\\n## Further Reading\\n\\n- [Configuration](/configuration)\\n- [Advanced Usage](/advanced)\\n- [CI/CD Integration](/ci-cd)\\n- [FAQ](/faq)"}]}')}}]);
