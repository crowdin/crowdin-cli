Crowdin CLI is a command line tool that allows you to manage and synchronize your localization resources with your Crowdin project. Using CLI, you can:

- automate the process of updating your source files in your Crowdin project
- download translations from Crowdin and automatically save them in the correct locations
- upload all your existing translations to Crowdin in minutes
- integrate Crowdin with GIT, SVN, Mercurial, and other software

This is a cross-platform and it runs in a terminal on Linux based and macOS operating systems or in Command Prompt on Windows.
