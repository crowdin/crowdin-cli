# Crowdin CLI [![Tweet](https://img.shields.io/twitter/url/http/shields.io.svg?style=social)](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fcrowdin%2Fcrowdin-cli&text=Crowdin%20CLI%20is%20an%20open-source%20command-line%20tool%20that%20allows%20you%20to%20manage%20and%20synchronize%20your%20localization%20resources%20with%20your%20Crowdin%20project)

Crowdin CLI is a command line tool that allows you to manage and synchronize your localization resources with your Crowdin project. Using CLI, you can:

- automate the process of updating your source files in your Crowdin project
- download translations from Crowdin and automatically save them in the correct locations
- upload all your existing translations to Crowdin in minutes
- integrate Crowdin with GIT, SVN, Mercurial, and other software

This is a cross-platform and it runs in a terminal on Linux based and macOS operating systems or in Command Prompt on Windows.

## Running the App

Use the following method to run the app:

```console
crowdin
```

Alternative method:

```console
java -jar crowdin-cli.jar
```

## Configuration

Crowdin CLI uses a YAML configuration file that contains a description of the resources to manage: files to be uploaded into Crowdin and the locations of the corresponding translations.

To use Crowdin CLI, you should first generate your configuration file and then run the tool. By default, Crowdin CLI looks for a configuration file named *crowdin.yaml* or *crowdin.yml* (so you don’t have to specify the file name unless it’s different from *crowdin.yaml*).

To create the configuration file run the following command:

```console
crowdin init
```

When calling Crowdin CLI in terminal make sure you are in your project root directory. Otherwise, you need to specify a configuration file path using  `--config` option:

```console
crowdin upload sources --config /path/to/your/config/file
```

Sample configuration file:

```yaml
"project_id": "12"
"api_token": "54e01--your-personal-token--2724a"
"base_path": "."
"base_url": "https://api.crowdin.com" # https://{organization-name}.crowdin.com

"preserve_hierarchy": true

"files": [
  {
    "source" : "/t1/**/*",
    "translation" : "/%two_letters_code%/%original_file_name%"
  }
]
```

For more information how to configure Crowdin CLI, check <a href="https://support.crowdin.com/configuration-file/" target="_blank">Configuration File</a> article.

## Usage

Once the configuration file is created, you can use Crowdin CLI to manage your localization resources and automate file synchronization.

### General Commands

To display help information:

```console
crowdin -h
```

```console
crowdin <command> -h
```

To generate skeleton configuration file:

```console
crowdin init
```

To check configuration file for general mistakes:

```console
crowdin lint
```

To display a list of files uploaded to Crowdin:

```console
crowdin list project
```

### Uploading Resources

To upload source files to Crowdin:

```console
crowdin upload sources
```

To upload single file without a configuration:

```console
crowdin upload sources \
    -s path/to/your/file \
    -t file/export/pattern \
    -T personal-access-token \
    -i project-id \
    --base-url https://api.crowdin.com
```

Use <a href="https://support.crowdin.com/configuration-file/#placeholders" target="_blank">placeholders</a> to put appropriate variables.

To display a list of files that will be uploaded to Crowdin:

```console
crowdin upload sources --dryrun
```

To upload existing translations to Crowdin (translations will be synchronized):

```console
crowdin upload translations
```

To show detailed information about the `upload` command:

```console
crowdin upload --help
```

## Downloading Translations

To download the latest translations from Crowdin:

```console
crowdin download
```

To download the latest translations for the specific language (<a href="https://support.crowdin.com/api/language-codes/" target="_blank">language codes</a>):

```console
crowdin download -l {language_code}
```

To display a list of the latest translations from Crowdin:

```console
crowdin download --dryrun
```

To show detailed information about the `download` command:

```console
crowdin download --help
```

## Versions Management

There is no need to run specific command to create version branches if you use synchronization tool. The version branch is created automatically during the files upload.

To upload source files to the specified version branch:

```console
crowdin upload sources -b {branch_name}
```

To upload translations to the specified version branch:

```console
crowdin upload translations -b {branch_name}
```

To download translations from the specified version branch:

```console
crowdin download -b {branch_name}
```

## Source strings management

|Command                   | Description                     |

|--------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| `crowdin status`               | Show translation and proofreading progress for a project |
| `crowdin status translation`   | Show only translation progress for a project |
| `crowdin status proofreading`  | Show only proofreading progress for a project |
