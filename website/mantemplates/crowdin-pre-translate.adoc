=== Notes

Crowdin CLI uses the crowdin.yml configuration to Pre-Translate files.

At first, it finds local source files that match the source configuration pattern. hen CLI tries to find the corresponding files in the crowdin project.
After that, CLI will request pre-translation for the found file IDs (matching these files to local sources and configuration file).
