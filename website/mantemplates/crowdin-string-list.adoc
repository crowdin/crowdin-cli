=== Notes

When passing CroQL queries or any argument that includes double quotes ("), correct escaping is required depending on the shell you are using.

If you do not use an link:https://crowdin.github.io/crowdin-cli/advanced#argument-file[argument file], here is how to manually format your command:

- Bash (Linux, macOS, Git Bash)
Use single quotes ' around the entire query:

```bash
crowdin string list --croql 'identifier CONTAINS "label"'
```

- PowerShell
Escape each double quote " by using escaped backticks `:

```powershell
crowdin string list --croql "identifier CONTAINS \`"label\`""
```

- cmd.exe (Command Prompt)
Escape double quotes by doubling them "":

```cmd
crowdin string list --croql "identifier CONTAINS ""label"""
```
