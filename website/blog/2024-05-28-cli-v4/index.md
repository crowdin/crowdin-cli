Today we are happy to announce Crowdin CLI 4.0! ðŸ¥³

Almost 5 years have passed since the release of Crowdin CLI 3.0. During this time we've received a lot of feedback from our users and worked hard to improve the tool. We've made many changes and improvements.

The new version of Crowdin CLI brings a lot of new features and improvements. We've added new commands, updated existing commands and improved the overall user experience.

This post is intended to highlight the most important changes and help you migrate from CLI v3 with ease. It is not a comprehensive guide, but rather a list of the most important changes.

<!--truncate-->

## Requirements

As part of this release, the minimum Java version has been updated to **17 LTS**.

## New commands

- [`crowdin config`](/commands/crowdin-config)
- [`crowdin project`](/commands/crowdin-project)
- [`crowdin language`](/commands/crowdin-language)
- [`crowdin branch clone`](/commands/crowdin-branch-clone)
- [`crowdin branch merge`](/commands/crowdin-branch-merge)
- [`crowdin completion`](/autocompletion)

## Command updates

### Pre-translate

We've made significant changes to the [`pre-translate`](/commands/crowdin-pre-translate) command. The command now requires the `--file` parameter for file-based projects. The `--file` parameter determines which files to pre-translate. Previously, the command relied on the current configuration, and it was only possible to pre-translate the files that matched the configuration patterns. Now you can specify any file(s) in the Crowdin project to pre-translate.

Tip: Use the [`file list`](/commands/crowdin-file-list) command to get the file paths in the current project.

### String

* Added the `--branch` parameter support instead of specifying a branch in the file path in the [`string add`](/commands/crowdin-string-add) command.
* The [`string edit`](/commands/crowdin-string-edit) command changes:
  * Moved `id` to parameter.
  * Now `--identifier` is used as an option to edit and not to find the needed string.
* The [`string delete`](/commands/crowdin-string-delete) command changes:
  * Moved `id` to parameter. Now only 1 string can be removed at a time.
  * Removed the `--text` and `--identifier` options. Only `id` is used as a string identifier.
* Added `--directory` and `--scope` options to the [`string list`](/commands/crowdin-string-list) command.
* `comment` command was moved to [`comment add`](/commands/crowdin-comment-add) command.

```diff
-crowdin string add Download --file main/src/strings.xml --identifier "download"
+crowdin string add Download --file src/strings.xml --branch main --identifier "download"

-crowdin string edit --id 12 --text new
+crowdin string edit 12 --text new

-crowdin string delete --id 12
+crowdin string delete 12
```

### List

* The `list branches` command has been replaced with the [`branch list`](/commands/crowdin-branch-list) command.
* The `list sources` command has been replaced with the [`config sources`](/commands/crowdin-config-sources) command.
* The `list translations` command has been replaced with the [`config translations`](/commands/crowdin-config-translations) command.
* The `list project` command has been replaced with the [`file list`](/commands/crowdin-file-list) command.
  * Added verbose (`--verbose`) output.
  * Added a possibility to download translations for all project languages (`-l all`).
* The `list languages` command has been replaced with the [`language list`](/commands/crowdin-language-list) command.
  * Changed default `code` for list command. Now it's `id` instead of `two_letters_code`. It's more convenient since the `id` is used for the `--language` parameter in various commands.
  * Added a new parameter `--all` which allows to list all languages for the current account.

```diff
-crowdin list branches
+crowdin branch list

-crowdin list project
+crowdin file list

-crowdin list sources
+crowdin config sources

-crowdin list translations
+crowdin config translations

-crowdin list languages
+crowdin language list
```

### Glossary

The `name` property has been removed from the `upload` and `download` commands:

```diff
-crowdin glossary download --id <id>
-crowdin glossary download --name <name>
+crowdin glossary download <id>

-crowdin glossary upload <file> --name <name>
+crowdin glossary upload <file> --id <id>
```

Tip: Use the [`glossary list`](/commands/crowdin-glossary-list) command to get the `id`.

### TM

The `name` property has been removed from `upload` and `download` commands:

```diff
-crowdin tm download --id <id>
-crowdin tm download --name <name>
+crowdin tm download <id>

-crowdin tm upload <file> --name <name>
+crowdin tm upload <file> --id <id>
```

Tip: Use the [`tm list`](/commands/crowdin-tm-list) command to get the `id`.

### Screenshot

The `name` parameter has been replaced with the `id` for the `delete` command because there can be multiple screenshots with the same name:

```diff
-crowdin screenshot delete <name>
+crowdin screenshot delete <id>
```

Tip: Use the [`screenshot list`](/commands/crowdin-screenshot-list) command to get the `id`.

### Init

The `generate` alias has been removed:

```diff
-crowdin generate
+crowdin init
```

New `quiet` option was added to not ask for interactive input prompts.

### Lint

The `lint` command has been replaced with the [`config lint`](/commands/crowdin-config-lint) command:

```diff
- crowdin lint
+ crowdin config lint
```

### Bundle

The `download bundle` command has been replaced with the [`bundle download`](/commands/crowdin-bundle-download) command.

## Exit codes

This release also includes more exit codes (previously we only had `0` for success and `1` for failure).

See the [official documentation](/exit-codes) for more details.

## Environment variables

Previously, it was necessary to specify the environment variables in the configuration file in order to load the configuration from them.

Now the CLI can automatically pick up the environment variables if they are set in the shell. The supported environment variables are:

- `CROWDIN_PROJECT_ID`
- `CROWDIN_PERSONAL_TOKEN`
- `CROWDIN_BASE_PATH`
- `CROWDIN_BASE_URL`

Thanks to this change, it's now easier to work with the CLI in CI/CD environments, especially in the no-configuration-file use case.

Visit the [Configuration File](/configuration#environment-variables) article for more details.

## Deprecations and backward compatibility

### Download targets

The deprecated `download targets` command has been removed. The configuration file no longer supports the `targets` section as well. Use [Bundles](/commands/crowdin-bundle) instead.

### Task command

Removed backward compatibility for file numeric id in the [`task add`](/commands/crowdin-task-add) command. Now only file path is supported:

```diff
-crowdin task add --file 12 --language uk
+crowdin task add --file src/strings.xml --language uk
```

## Command output updates

In this release, we've also reviewed and improved the output of many commands to make them more informative and user-friendly. Changes include `list`, `add`, `upload`, `download`, `delete`, and other commands for various resources.
